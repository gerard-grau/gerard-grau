### Hi there, I'm Gerard Grau
I'm a student in Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, in both Data Science & Engineering, and Mathematics.

Here are the projects I've worked on:
- [Dathathon FME 2023](https://github.com/guimCC/Dathon2023-Mango):
During Datathon FME 2023, our team created a groundbreaking AI tool designed to provide outfit recommendations in line with a brand's core philosophy. The challenge we tackled involved integrating varied data types, ranging from tabular data to image features. Our solution centered around combining product data with features extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This enriched dataset was then input into a Transformer model, allowing us to generate outfit suggestions that align seamlessly with a brand's identity.

- [Cinebus](https://github.com/gerardgrau/Cinebus):
The Cinebus application is a tool designed for users in Barcelona to choose a movie from the local cinema listings, and it provides a route from their current location to the cinema where the selected movie is being shown. The application is implemented in Python and uses web scraping techniques to gather cinema and movie information. It consists of four modules: billboard.py for reading cinema listings, buses.py for creating a bus network graph, city.py for creating a city map graph, and demo.py for the graphical user interface. The application also incorporates features like filtering movies, displaying bus and city maps, and finding the shortest path to a selected movie. The use of graphs for representing bus routes and the city layout is highlighted, along with a detailed explanation of the implementation. The usability aspects, such as searching for movies, displaying bus and city maps, and planning routes from the user's location to a desired movie, are also discussed. The authors of the application are Gerard Grau Garcia and Pol Resina Martínez.
