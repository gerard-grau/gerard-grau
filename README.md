### Hi there, I'm Gerard Grau

I'm a student in Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, in both Data Science & Engineering, and Mathematics.

Here are the projects I've worked on:
<!--
1. [Datathon FME 2023 - **Outfit Generator**](https://github.com/guimCC/Dathon2023-Mango):
AI tool to generate outfits in line with a brand's core philosophy
-->

1. [**Fantasy Football**](https://github.com/polresi/Fantasy-Football):
Algorithm that obtains the best football lineup based on a database of active players. Primarily constructed using C++.

2. [Datathon FME 2022 - **Chip Power Delivery**](https://github.com/NIU1668278/Qualcomm-Challenge-):
Based on the solution to a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem using both Genetic Algorithms and Simmulated Annealing

3. [**Cinebus**](https://github.com/gerard-grau/cinebus):
Desktop app that lets users search for movie listings and provides them with a route from their location to the cinema's location, using Barcelona's real bus network.

4. [**Workgroup Manager**](https://github.com/gerard-grau/workgroup-manager):
Desktop app that simplifies the coordination of a work group. It provides users a tool to input their availability for project each group, and a visual representation (calendar) of all members' available days, among other features.


I'm always open to new opportunities, let's connect!
