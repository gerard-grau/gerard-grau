### Hi there, I'm Gerard Grau
I'm a student in Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, in both Data Science & Engineering, and Mathematics.

Here are the projects I've worked on:
1. [Dathathon FME 2023](https://github.com/guimCC/Dathon2023-Mango):
During Datathon FME 2023, our team created a groundbreaking AI tool designed to provide outfit recommendations in line with a brand's core philosophy. The challenge we tackled involved integrating varied data types, ranging from tabular data to image features. Our solution centered around combining product data with features extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This enriched dataset was then input into a Transformer model, allowing us to generate outfit suggestions that align seamlessly with a brand's identity.

2. [Dathathon FME 2022](https://github.com/NIU1668278/Qualcomm-Challenge-):
This is our submission to the Qualcomm challenge. Our team tackled the challenge by first clustering power switches based on area considerations, reducing computational complexity. We then applied a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm, experimenting with both Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. Simulated Annealing proved more effective, leveraging a slow cooling approach for a thorough search of the optimal solution.

3. [Cinebus](https://github.com/gerardgrau/Cinebus):
The Cinebus application is a tool designed for users in Barcelona to choose a movie from the local cinema listings, and it provides a route from their current location to the cinema where the selected movie is being shown. The application is implemented in Python and uses web scraping techniques to gather cinema and movie information. It consists of four modules: billboard.py for reading cinema listings, buses.py for creating a bus network graph, city.py for creating a city map graph, and demo.py for the graphical user interface. The application also incorporates features like filtering movies, displaying bus and city maps, and finding the shortest path to a selected movie. The use of graphs for representing bus routes and the city layout is highlighted, along with a detailed explanation of the implementation. The usability aspects, such as searching for movies, displaying bus and city maps, and planning routes from the user's location to a desired movie, are also discussed. 

4. [Workgroup Manager](https://github.com/gerardgrau/workgroup-manager):
The Workgroup Manager is a Python application designed to address the needs of a university student who frequently collaborates on group projects. Coordinating schedules with a large number of group members can be challenging. This application allows each group member to input their availability for project work, and it displays a visual representation of all members' available days. This simplifies the process of determining the days with the most available group members for collaborative work.
Its main features incluede cross-platform compatibility, user account/group creation, administration, and data integrity. External notifications are partially achieved, with recommendations for future development including implementing desktop notifications/emails, exploring alternative availability input methods, and visually displaying group deadlines on the calendar.
