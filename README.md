### Hi there, I'm Gerard Grau

I'm a student in Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, in both Data Science & Engineering, and Mathematics.

Here are the projects I've worked on:

1. [Datathon FME 2023](https://github.com/guimCC/Dathon2023-Mango):
AI tool to generate outfits in line with a brand's core philosophy.

2. [Datathon FME 2022](https://github.com/NIU1668278/Qualcomm-Challenge-):
Based on the solution to a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem using both Genetic Algorithms and Simmulated Annealing

4. [Cinebus](https://github.com/gerardgrau/Cinebus):
Desktop app that lets users search for movie listings and provides them with a route from their location to the cinema's location, using Barcelona's real bus network.

5. [Workgroup Manager](https://github.com/gerardgrau/workgroup-manager):
Desktop app that simplifies the coordination of a work group. It provides users a tool to input their availability for project each group, and a visual representation (calendar) of all members' available days.


I'm always open to new opportunities!
