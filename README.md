### Hi there, I'm Gerard Grau

Microsoft intern pursuing a dual degree in Data Science & Engineering and in Mathematics at UPC Barcelona.

Here are the projects I've worked on:
<!--
1. [Datathon FME 2023 - **Outfit Generator**](https://github.com/guimCC/Dathon2023-Mango):
AI tool to generate outfits in line with a brand's core philosophy
-->

* [_HackUPC 2024_ - **Street Style Decoder**](https://github.com/gerard-grau/HackUPC2024) :
An app that lets you take a picture of an outfit and obtain similar clothes. Made using image embedding and semantic segmentation.

* [**Song Poplarity Predictor**](https://github.com/gerard-grau/song-popularity-predictor) :
A machine learning project predicting the popularity of Taylor Swift's songs using classical ML models such as linear models, decision trees, ensemble methods, and support vector machines.

* [_2024 France Tech Arena_ - **LightChaser**](https://github.com/gerard-grau/LightChaser_2024-France-Tech-Arena) :
Our solution using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm to replan service paths after fiber failures. We optimized wavelength allocation, resolved resource conflicts, and maximized service continuity

* [**Fantasy Football**](https://github.com/polresi/Fantasy-Football) :
Algorithm that obtains the best football lineup based on a database of active players. Primarily constructed using C++.

* [_Datathon FME 2022_ - **Chip Power Delivery Optimization**](https://github.com/NIU1668278/Qualcomm-Challenge-) :
Based on the solution to a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem using both Genetic Algorithms and Simmulated Annealing

* [**Cinebus**](https://github.com/gerard-grau/cinebus) :
Desktop app that lets users search for movie listings and provides them with a route from their location to the cinema's location, using Barcelona's real bus network.

* [**Workgroup Manager**](https://github.com/gerard-grau/workgroup-manager) :
Desktop app that simplifies the coordination of a work group. It provides users a tool to input their availability for project each group, and a visual representation (calendar) of all members' available days, among other features.


I'm always open to new opportunities, let's connect!
